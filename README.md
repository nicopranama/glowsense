# GlowSense — AI-Powered Skincare Recommender using KNN

**GlowSense** is a Jupyter Notebook project that builds a skincare recommendation system using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.  
It analyzes skin type data (such as RGB values, moisture level, etc.) and suggests the most suitable skincare products based on similarity to known skin profiles.

## Overview

The workflow includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing** — cleaning and normalizing dataset
2. **Feature Extraction** — converting images or numerical features into model-ready data
3. **KNN Classification** — classifying skin types based on nearest neighbors
4. **Model Evaluation** — measuring accuracy and performance
5. **Product Recommendation** — mapping skin type results to suggested skincare products

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **scikit-learn** — KNN implementation
- **pandas** — data manipulation
- **numpy** — numerical computation
- **matplotlib / seaborn** — data visualization
